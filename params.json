  "body": "### Overview\r\nPALLADIO is a data analytics framework that is able to obtain unbiased and statistically robust variable selection on high-dimensional datasets. The framework uses several parallel computing paradigms which allows to critically reduce the computational time.\r\n\r\nThe framework is completely open source and it is released under GNU General Public License v3.0. PALLADIO id developed in Python to benefit from its ease of integration with other programming languages and protocols such as C++, CUDA and MPI as well as from its maintainability. \r\n\r\nPALLADIO is designed for HPC clusters architectures. Job distribution is carried out by MPI and it integrates CUDA kernels to deal with massively parallel element-wise operations.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nPALLADIO is developed using Python 2.7 and inherits its main functionalities from:\r\n* numpy\r\n* scipy\r\n* scikit-learn\r\n* mpi4py\r\n* matplotlib\r\n* seaborn\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrent developers: Matteo Barbieri (@matteobarbieri), Samuele Fiorini (@samuelefiorini) and Federico Tomasi (@fdtomasi).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with PALLADIO?
